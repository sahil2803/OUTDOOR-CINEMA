## Fonts and Icons

To maintain a consistent design across our project, we're using specific fonts and icon sets. Follow these instructions to include them in your development environment.

### 1. Fonts

We are using the **Bebas Neue** font from Google Fonts. To add this font to your project, follow these steps:

1. **Add the Google Fonts link** to the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

    ```html
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bebas+Neue&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    ```

2. **Apply the font** in your CSS file. For example:

    ```css
    body {
        font-family: 'Bebas Neue', sans-serif;
    }
    ```

### 2. Icons & Colour scheme

We are using the **Font Awesome** icon pack. To include Font Awesome in your project, do the following:

1. **Add the Font Awesome stylesheet link** to the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.2/css/all.min.css">
    ```

2. **Use icons** in your HTML by including the appropriate Font Awesome classes. For example:

    ```html
    <i class="fas fa-camera"></i>
    ```

    You can explore available icons and their class names on the [Font Awesome website](https://fontawesome.com/icons).
### Colour Scheme
     #ffffff 
     #212121
     #2e31c7
     #6F9CEB
     #FF331F
### Summary

- **Fonts:** Include the Google Fonts link in your HTML and set the `font-family` in your CSS.
- **Icons:** Add the Font Awesome stylesheet link in your HTML and use icon classes where needed.
